I see, my apologies for the confusion. Let's clarify the description for `KF_Application` in the context of the KeysFortress architecture.

# KF_Application

`KF_Application` serves as the business layer within the KeysFortress architecture, encapsulating the application-specific logic and use cases. This submodule, injected as a part of both KeysFortress Mobile and KeysFortress Desktop repositories, is responsible for orchestrating interactions between the user interface (UI) and the core business logic.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `KF_Application` is to house the application-specific use cases and business logic. It acts as an intermediary layer between the user interface (handled by `KF_Presentation`) and the core business entities and rules (managed by `KF_Domain`). This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the application more modular, testable, and maintainable.

## Key Features

### 1. Use Case Implementation

`KF_Application` implements use cases that are specific to the KeysFortress application. These use cases define the unique functionalities and interactions that the application offers to its users.

### 2. Business Logic

The submodule houses the application-specific business logic that governs how data is processed, validated, and transformed based on user inputs and external events.

### 3. Interactions with UI

`KF_Application` facilitates the communication between the user interface components (managed by `KF_Presentation`) and the underlying business logic, ensuring a smooth flow of information and actions.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance and extend application-specific use cases and business logic are encouraged. If you identify opportunities for improvement, new features, or optimizations, consider submitting a pull request to strengthen the application layer of KeysFortress.
